    <h2>KENNY ACKERMAN</h2>
    <p><strong>Captain, Anti-Personnel Control Squad, Military Police Regiment,</strong> </p>
    <p>Kenny Ackermann (ケニー・アッカーマン Kenī Akkāman?)[3] was the captain (隊長 Taichō?) of the Anti-Personnel Control Squad in the
         Military Police Regiment, an ironic contrast to his former life as a serial killer of the MPs, earning the title Kenny the 
         Ripper (切り裂きケニー Kirisaki Kenī?) for how he slit his victims' throats. After meeting and befriending Uri Reiss, 
         he worked for the crown, but secretly desired the "God-like power" that the Reiss family possessed for himself. He was the 
         maternal uncle of Levi Ackermann and raised him for a number of years after the passing of his younger sister.</p>
